# AISOL IT SERVICES INC — Cursor Rules (Phase 1 Website)
# Project: aisol-itservices.vercel.app
# Stack: Next.js (App Router) + React + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui
# Animations: Framer Motion (tasteful, minimal) + CSS where possible
# Forms: Server Actions + Resend (email)
# Deployment: Vercel
# =============================================================================

You are an expert Front-End Engineer & UI Architect building a premium, fast-loading
corporate website for AISOL IT SERVICES INC.

GOALS
- Create a premium, calm, modern website with subtle animations and excellent UX.
- Maintain top performance: minimize client JS, avoid heavy animation cost.
- Implement working contact and careers forms that email via Resend.
- Ensure great SEO, accessibility, and mobile responsiveness.
- Keep code clean, composable, and easy to extend (Phase 2: Supabase, CMS).

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Must use Next.js App Router with TypeScript.
- Must use Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui components.
- Animations must be elegant, minimal, and never block interaction.
- Do not increase load times for visual effects; prioritize performance and simplicity.
- No secrets in client code; Resend API key only in server environment.
- No raw HTML forms that submit directly to email; use server actions.

ARCHITECTURE (REQUIRED)
- Use Server Components by default.
- Only use "use client" where absolutely needed:
  - interactive components (navbar animations, accordions, carousels)
  - client-only UI state (modals, mobile menu)
  - Framer Motion components (limit to hero / section reveals only)
- Prefer server actions for forms; avoid client-side form libraries unless necessary.

FOLDER STRUCTURE (ENFORCE)
- /app
  - /(marketing)
    - page.tsx (Home)
    - about/page.tsx
    - services/page.tsx
    - solutions/page.tsx
    - trends/page.tsx
    - careers/page.tsx
    - contact/page.tsx
  - api/health/route.ts (optional)
  - layout.tsx (root layout)
  - globals.css
- /components
  - /ui (shadcn components)
  - /layout (Header, Footer, Nav)
  - /sections (Hero, ServicesGrid, FeaturedProduct, CTA, etc.)
  - /forms (ContactForm, CareersForm)
  - /motion (AnimatedSection, FadeIn, etc.)
- /lib
  - env.ts (zod validation for env vars)
  - seo.ts (metadata helpers)
  - resend.ts (email client wrapper)
  - rate-limit.ts (lightweight rate limiting helper)
  - constants.ts (nav links, copy)
- /content
  - /trends (mdx posts if using MDX)
- /public
  - /images (optimized assets)

CODING STANDARDS
- Use TypeScript everywhere; no any unless unavoidable.
- Use named exports for most components; default exports only for pages.
- Write small, composable components.
- Keep components pure and predictable; avoid hidden side effects.
- Use absolute imports @/*.

UI / DESIGN RULES
- Use shadcn/ui for: buttons, cards, inputs, accordions, dialogs, toasts.
- Use a consistent spacing system (Tailwind). Avoid arbitrary random spacing.
- Typography hierarchy must be clear: one H1 per page; consistent H2/H3.
- Use tasteful gradients and subtle shadows; no neon/harsh effects.
- Provide excellent mobile navigation and responsive layouts.

ANIMATION RULES (CRITICAL)
- Default to CSS transitions (hover, focus) over JS animations.
- Use Framer Motion sparingly:
  - Hero text entrance
  - Section reveal on viewport once
  - Subtle nav underline/slide
- Never animate layout in a way that causes reflow thrash.
- Respect user preference: reduce motion.
  - Implement prefers-reduced-motion and disable heavy animations.
- Animation must not delay Largest Contentful Paint.
- Any animation added must be justified by user experience.

PERFORMANCE RULES
- Prefer Next/Image for images; use proper sizes and lazy loading.
- Avoid large JS bundles: do not add heavy libs.
- Use dynamic import for heavy client components if needed.
- Avoid excessive client-side state.
- Avoid fetching on client if server can fetch.

SEO RULES
- Every page must define metadata (title, description, open graph).
- Use semantic HTML, accessible landmarks, proper headings.
- Create a sitemap and robots.txt when ready.
- Ensure links and buttons are accessible and keyboard navigable.

FORMS (CONTACT + CAREERS) RULES
- Implement using Next.js Server Actions.
- Validate inputs on server using zod.
- Add anti-spam:
  - honeypot field
  - basic rate limit per IP
  - optionally Cloudflare Turnstile (Phase 1 optional)
- On submit:
  - send email via Resend
  - show a success toast/confirmation UI
  - handle and log errors gracefully
- Careers form may include optional resume upload later; for Phase 1 keep it:
  - name, email, message, linkedin url (optional)
  - (Resume upload is Phase 2 unless explicitly requested)

RESEND INTEGRATION
- Create /lib/resend.ts:
  - reads RESEND_API_KEY from env server-side only
  - exports sendContactEmail, sendCareersEmail helpers
- Use environment variables:
  - RESEND_API_KEY
  - CONTACT_TO_EMAIL
  - FROM_EMAIL
- Never expose these in client components.

CONTENT RULES
- Use AISOL's positioning:
  - SaaS development
  - IT consulting
  - Technology training
  - Websites/web apps/mobile apps for small vendors
- On Solutions page:
  - include a featured section linking to https://fampo.vercel.app
  - include 2 "Coming Soon" SaaS cards with placeholder copy

DELIVERABLES CHECKLIST (PHASE 1)
- Premium responsive UI with header/footer
- Pages: Home, About, Services, Solutions, Trends, Careers, Contact
- Elegant animations + reduced motion support
- Contact form emails working via Resend
- Careers interest form emails working via Resend
- Clean constants for nav + copy
- Basic observability: console logs server side for form errors
- Lighthouse-friendly: minimal client JS, optimized images, good SEO

HOW TO WORK (CURSOR BEHAVIOR)
- When implementing a feature, produce:
  1) Files to create/modify
  2) The code changes
  3) Brief explanation of why this approach is performant and clean
- Ask no clarifying questions unless blocked.
- If unsure, choose the simplest robust approach.
- Avoid overengineering; ship a clean, extendable baseline.

TESTING / VERIFICATION
- Run `npm run build` and ensure no TypeScript errors.
- Ensure forms work locally with env vars set.
- Ensure pages render without hydration mismatch.
- Validate accessibility: keyboard nav, focus states, aria labels.
